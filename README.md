# OWL
**“Transforming play, Unleashing ownership”**

## Project Overview:

### Overview of Idea:
OWL is a revolutionary gaming platform designed to tackle major issues in the gaming industry that platforms like Steam and Epic Games face, such as piracy, security concerns, centralization, non-fractional ownership, and non-transferable licenses. OWL offers a unique gaming experience with secure transactions, verifiable ownership, and the ability to resell games with reusable licenses.

### What is Steam?
Steam is a popular digital gaming platform where people can buy, download, and play video games. It acts like a digital store for games, much like how iTunes or Spotify works for music. On Steam, you can browse through a huge library of games, purchase them, and then download them directly to your computer. Once you buy a game, it’s linked to your Steam account, and you can play it whenever you want.

When you buy a game on Steam, you're actually purchasing a digital license to play that game. This license is tied to your Steam account, so you can download and play the game on any device where you're logged into your account. However, you don't own the game in a way that allows you to sell or give it to someone else; it's like having a permanent rental.
If Steam's servers are down, you might not be able to access your games until they are back online. Steam has the power to revoke access to your games if they choose to. They have complete centralized authority over your games.

### Problem Statement:
**Piracy and Security:**  
Unauthorized copying and distribution of games can lead to significant revenue loss for developers and compromise game integrity. It also raises security risks, such as malware in pirated copies.  

**Centralization:**  
Games are often controlled by a single entity, limiting user control and flexibility. This centralization can lead to restrictive policies and potential loss of access to purchased games if the platform shuts down or changes terms.  

**Non-Fractional Ownership (Single Entity Ownership):**  
Players typically do not have a stake in the games they purchase; they only buy the right to play. This lack of ownership means users can't benefit from the game's success or value growth.  

**Non-Transferable License:**  
Most platforms do not allow players to resell or transfer their game licenses. Once a game is purchased, the user is stuck with it, even if they no longer wish to play it, reducing flexibility and value for the consumer.

### Solutions:
**License as NFT:**  
- For every game purchased on OWL, users receive a unique Non-Fungible Token (NFT) associated with that specific game.
- The NFT acts as the license key which is used to verify the game's legitimacy.
- This license key is utilized to activate the purchased game, ensuring a seamless and controlled access process.

**Blockchain Integration:**  
- OWL utilizes Diamante Blockchain to push proof of transactions onto the chain. This enhances transparency and security.
- It guarantees that users never lose ownership of their purchased games.

**Resell Option with Reusable Licenses:**  
- A unique feature of OWL is the ability to resell games that users have already bought.
- The platform supports reusable licenses, allowing users to resell their games to others. However, the number of resell transactions is limited, striking a balance between user flexibility and maintaining the integrity of the gaming ecosystem.

### Business Model:
When the company chooses to publish, as long as your game fits in with OWL, you will only need to create an account and pay a one-time fee of $55 to publish your game on OWL. OWL will give you the money back if your game makes $1,000 in gross revenue from sales on OWL.

OWL will take commission on the basis of growth of sales (for each game sold):  
- For the first 500k sales, the commission will be 20% for OWL.
- For the range of 500k to 1 million sales, the commission will be 25%.
- For the range greater than 1 million, the commission will be 30%.

**For user-user transactions:**  
When a user wants to sell a preowned game, OWL will include an extra fee of 22% (15% for the company and 7% for OWL).

When listing on OWL, a trimonthly plan would be followed and the cost will be affordable ($5). If it goes well, OWL gets a 5% cut and also returns the listing price. If not, the listing price is kept by OWL.
